# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

FancyCMDBConcept - A new project that appears to be a concept for a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) system. The repository is currently empty and ready for initial development.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, the development environment and toolchain have not yet been established. When setting up the project, consider:

- Choose appropriate technology stack (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)
- Set up package management (npm/yarn, pip, go mod, etc.)
- Configure build tools and scripts
- Establish testing framework
- Set up linting and code formatting

## Commands

No build, test, or development commands have been established yet. These will need to be added as the project structure is defined.

## Architecture

The project architecture is to be determined. This section should be updated once the core structure and components are implemented.

## Notes

- This is a greenfield project - no existing code or constraints
- CMDB typically involves configuration item tracking, dependency mapping, and change management
- Consider scalability, data modeling, and integration requirements from the start
